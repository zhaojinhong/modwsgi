#summary Software available for download.

# Source Code Downloads #

Source code downloads are now being done from GitHub rather than from
this site. The GitHub source code repository is:

  * https://github.com/GrahamDumpleton/mod_wsgi

Downloadable release files can be found at:

  * https://github.com/GrahamDumpleton/mod_wsgi/releases

Note that version 3.5 of mod\_wsgi contains a fix for a security related
issue. It is recommended that prior versions of mod\_wsgi not be used. See
the list of changes in the release notes for more information.

For a list of changes in all versions of mod\_wsgi see:

  * http://modwsgi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/release-notes/index.html

For details on how to install from the source code see:

  * [Quick Installation Guide](QuickInstallationGuide.md)

# Windows Binary Downloads #

Variations of precompiled binaries for Windows are no longer made available
from this site. Precompiled binaries of mod\_wsgi built by a third party, can
instead be downloaded from:

  * http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#mod_wsgi

For guidelines on how to install these files see:

  * [Installation On Windows](InstallationOnWindows.md)

Note that these guidelines were originally from when binaries were made
available from this site, so likely will need to be adjusted based on how the
third party version has been packaged.
