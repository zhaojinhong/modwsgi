#summary How to contribute back to mod\_wsgi.

# Who Are The Developers #

The mod\_wsgi package is a solo effort by
[Graham Dumpleton](http://blog.dscpl.com.au).

The package is developed purely in the author's spare time and is not
funded in any way by a company, nor is it developed for a specific
companies requirements. In fact the author doesn't even develop it for his
own needs. It is developed purely because it represents an interesting
technical challenge and not because the author needs it himself to host a
web site.

# How To Make A Donation #

Donations can be made via
[PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=636842),
an Amazon (USA store only) gift certificate sent to _Graham.Dumpleton@gmail.com_ or using
[Gittip](https://www.gittip.com/GrahamDumpleton/).

A suggested formula for how much to donate is:

  * If using mod\_wsgi for personal use, then consider donating what you would pay for one month worth of web hosting services for your own site.

  * If using mod\_wsgi for a company web site, then consider donating what you would pay for two months worth of web hosting services for that site.

  * If using mod\_wsgi as part of a web hosting service which you then charge other people for using, then consider donating what you would charge a customer for three months worth of web hosting services.

In other words, be somewhat reasonable, and donate an amount commensurate
with how much benefit you are getting from mod\_wsgi. On that basis,
donations might realistically range from $10 up to $500 or more. Obviously
where your company spends ridiculous amounts of money on web hosting you
can instead elect to donate something more within the range stated above
rather than how much you actually spend on web hosting services.

# How Are Donations Used #

Any monetary donations typically go towards buying clothes, toys, music,
books and apps for the authors 2 children.

# How Else Can You Donate #

If you are an author of a book related to Apache, Python or web hosting in
general, then will also happily accept an electronic copy of it for
reference.
